Purpose of the app:
The Weather App serves as a practical tool for individuals seeking reliable weather forecasts to plan their weekly activities effectively. By allowing users to input maximum and minimum temperatures, as well as weather conditions, for each day of the week, the app provides a comprehensive overview of the upcoming weather conditions.

Explanation:
The app features three main screens. The first screen displays essential information such as the app logo, the title "Weather App," the developer's name, and student number. It also includes a "Start" button to proceed to the next screen.
The second screen, or the main screen, allows users to input weather data for each day of the week. Users can enter maximum and minimum temperatures, along with weather conditions like sunny, rainy, or overcast. The app calculates the average temperature for the week, providing users with valuable insights into the overall weather trend.
The third screen presents a detailed view of the week's forecast. It displays the entered weather data for each day, along with the average temperature for the week. Additionally, users can navigate back to the main screen using the "Back" button.
